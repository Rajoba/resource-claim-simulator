The Resource Claim Axiom
# 🚀 The Resource Claim Simulator
### *A Thermodynamic Macroeconomic Model*

**"Money is not gold. Money is a Path-Literal to physical resources. Wealth is the absence of entropy."**

This app is a thermodynamic economic simulator based on the **Resource Claim Axiom**. While classical MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) treats money as an infinite ledger entry, this model couples the money supply to the physical entropy of the biosphere.

## 🧠 The Axioms
1. **Fading Money UI:** As the ecological overshoot (per Will Rees) exceeds 1.7x, financial values fade. Money loses its "saturation" (purchasing power) as nature's equity declines.
2. **Entropy Tax:** Insurance premiums rise automatically with CO2 levels. They are the bookkeepers of destruction.
3. **The Spanish-Phosphorus Paradox:** Simulates the export of virtual water and phosphorus (The Morocco Connection)—where nominal wealth leads to physical insolvency.
4. **Tragedy of the Horizon:** A time-lag system simulates delayed climate damages hitting the financial system after several turns.

## 🛠 Features
- **SQLite Ledger:** Every transaction is stored as a "Path-Literal" (e.g., `[Bank] -> [Claim] -> [Resource] -> [Entropy]`).
- **Mars Crisis Mode:** Visualizes why a billionaire cannot "buy" a glass of water when the resource is extinct.
